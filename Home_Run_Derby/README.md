# Project 1 - Make a game.

I made a Home Run Derby style game for my first project of General Assembly's WDI.



## User Stories

* This is a one player game.  Player should be able to start the game and hit the pitches as they come automatically.
* On the start board the player can enter their name so it shows on the scoreboard.
* The player uses the "h" button to swing the bat when the ball is near the plate.
* There are either Home Runs or outs. 10 outs means game over.
* Players can restart the game and their high score will carry over to the next round.

## WireFrames


I will upload pictures at a later date.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript/JQuery
* Canvas

## What is unfinished

* Player animations do not work very well.
* The ball stays on the field after the hit, then disappears on the next pitch.

## What would I like to expand on?

* Making the game for 2 players and make it network-enabled.
* Using APIs to get actual MLB player data so players could choose an MLB player to hit with.  This could then change the color of the batters uniform
* More sound and on screen messages to interact with the player more.
* Getting better artwork to use for the field.
* Add "Statcast" like features that would show distance and exit velocity and other stats.
* More real physics based hitting. If the player hits the ball too early, they will pull the ball, if they hit the ball late it goes to the opposite field.
